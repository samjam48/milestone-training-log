# track

Generated from legacy-claude-plugin.

Use this when the user explicitly invokes `/planning-track` or requests the "track" workflow.

Follow this workflow:

# /track Command

Create a tracking item in the appropriate tracking document.

## Usage

```
/track [type] [description]
```

**Examples:**
- `/track bug Login fails on mobile Safari`
- `/track task Update API documentation`
- `/track idea Add dark mode support`
- `/track devblog-post How we built realtime sync`

## CRITICAL: Discover Custom Tracker Types First

Before creating a tracker item, **always check for custom tracker types** defined in the workspace:

1. Look for YAML files in `.nimbalyst/trackers/*.yaml` in the workspace root
2. Each YAML file defines a custom tracker type with a `type:` field (e.g., `type: devblog-post`)
3. The `type` field in the YAML is what goes after `#` in the tracker syntax (e.g., `#devblog-post[...]`)
4. The `idPrefix` field determines the ID prefix (e.g., `dev` produces IDs like `dev_abc123`)
5. Custom types have their own status options - use those, not the built-in ones

**If the user's requested type matches a custom tracker (even partially), use the custom type name exactly as defined in the YAML.**

For example, if `.nimbalyst/trackers/devblog-post.yaml` exists with `type: devblog-post`, then:
- `/track dev-blog Something` should use `#devblog-post`, NOT `#plan` or `#blog`
- The file goes in `nimbalyst-local/tracker/devblog-posts.md`, NOT `plans.md`

## Built-in Tracker Types

These are always available:
- **bugs.md**: Issues and defects (`#bug`)
- **tasks.md**: Work items and todos (`#task`)
- **ideas.md**: Concepts to explore (`#idea`)
- **decisions.md**: Important decisions (`#decision`)
- **plans.md**: Plans and features (`#plan`)

## Custom Tracker Types

Defined in `.nimbalyst/trackers/*.yaml`. Common custom types:
- **feature-requests.md**: User requests (`#feature-request`)
- **tech-debt.md**: Technical debt (`#tech-debt`)
- **devblog-posts.md**: Dev blog posts (`#devblog-post`)
- Any other type defined in the workspace's YAML files

## Item Format

```markdown
- [Brief description] #[type][id:[idPrefix]_[ulid] status:[default-status] priority:medium created:YYYY-MM-DD]
```

The `[type]` and `[idPrefix]` come from the tracker YAML definition. The `[default-status]` comes from the first status option in the YAML, or `to-do` for built-in types.

## Execution Steps

1. **Check `.nimbalyst/trackers/*.yaml`** for custom tracker types that match the user's request
2. Parse the type from the command - match against custom types first, then built-in types
3. Use the correct `type` name and `idPrefix` from the YAML definition
4. Generate a unique ID using the prefix from the YAML (e.g., `dev_` for devblog-post)
5. Use the correct default status from the YAML definition
6. Determine priority from description keywords:
   - "critical", "urgent", "blocking" -> high/critical
   - "nice to have", "minor", "low" -> low
   - Otherwise -> medium
7. Add to `nimbalyst-local/tracker/[type]s.md` (pluralize the type name)
8. Confirm where the item was tracked

## CRITICAL: Do NOT Call tracker_create

**Never call the `tracker_create` MCP tool when executing /track.** The markdown file you write is automatically synced to the tracker widget via frontmatter/inline parsing. Calling `tracker_create` in addition to writing the markdown file creates a duplicate entry -- one from the file sync and one from the database insert. Only write the markdown file; the tracker system handles the rest.

## Best Practices

- Always check for custom tracker types before falling back to built-in ones
- Be specific in descriptions
- Include context when helpful
- Use the exact type name from the YAML definition
- Set priorities appropriately
